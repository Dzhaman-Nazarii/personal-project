If you haven’t written a single line of JS code yet and you are reading this text in a browser, on a desktop computer, it means that you are literally seconds away from your first JavaScript program.",
						"There are other ways to run JS code in a browser. So, if we talk about the usual use of JavaScript programs, they are loaded into the browser to ensure the operation of web pages. As a rule, the code is formatted as separate files with the .js extension, which are connected to web pages, but the program code can also be included directly in the page code. All this is done using the <script> tag. When the browser detects such code, it executes it. Details about the script tag can be found on the w3school.com website. In particular, let's look at an example demonstrating working with a web page using JavaScript, given on this resource."
